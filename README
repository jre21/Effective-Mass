This program computes the binding energies dopants in various
semiconducting crystals using the effective mass approximation.  The
Zinc-blende and Wurtzite crystal structures are supported, as well as
a generalized Wurtzite structure used in semiconductors with
alternating cations.  Several differing methods of approximating the
potential due to impurities are supported.  I used a mathematica
script to do initial symbolic processing on terms, but the majority of
the program is written in C++, using Gnu Scientific Library and ATLAS
to do the heavy lifting.  Any other cblas implementation can be used
in place of ATLAS by suitably editing the LDLIBS flag in the makefile.
